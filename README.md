# KKengraver Enhanced
A command line tool for a KKMoon laser engraver, improved version based on aquamorta's kkengraver

# Description of the engraver software

This software is intended to be used with a KKMoon laser engraver (3000mW).
It comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. It may or may not work with an other kind of
laser engraver.

## Preliminaries

First I have to thank aquamorta for the [aquamorta's kkengraver](https://github.com/aquamorta/kkengraver), a great Python program this script is based on.
I wanted to be able to engrave  and cut test samples with variing power, depth and amount of cutting passes. 

So this software does two thing:

1. Engrave tests with variing power and depth settings
2. Cutting tests with variing amount of cutting passes
